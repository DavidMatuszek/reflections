There should be some text here, I think. The "Commit New File"
button doesn't seem to do anything, so maybe adding text will fix that.
Yes, it did.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are not on your usual computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When working alone, I think I would want the automatic synchronization.
