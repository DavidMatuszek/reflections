There should be some text here, I think. The "Commit New File"

Yes, it did.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are not on your usual computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When working alone, I think I would want the automatic synchronization.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?
Forking is just cloning from GitHub to my account on GitHub. Cloning makes a copy of
any repository. Branches are variations of the contents of a repository.
